                <h2>FOOD AND NUTRITION</h2>

                <p>Food gives our bodies the energy we need to function. Food is also a part of traditions and culture. This can mean that eating has an emotional component as well. For many people, changing eating habits is very hard. You may have had certain
                    eating habits for so long that you do not realize they are unhealthy. Or, your habits have become part of your daily life, so you do not think much about them.</p>

                <p>The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace processed food with real food whenever possible. Eating food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a huge difference to the way you think, look, and feel.</p>

                <p>To set yourself up for success, try to keep things simple. Eating a healthier diet doesn’t have to be complicated. Instead of being overly concerned with counting calories, for example, think of your diet in terms of color, variety, and
                    freshness. Focus on avoiding packaged and processed foods and opting for more fresh ingredients whenever possible.</p>

                <p>Prepare more of your own meals. Cooking more meals at home can help you take charge of what you’re eating and better monitor exactly what goes into your food. You’ll eat fewer calories and avoid the chemical additives, added sugar, and
                    unhealthy fats of packaged and takeout foods that can leave you feeling tired, bloated, and irritable, and exacerbate symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety.</p>

                <p>Make the right changes. When cutting back on unhealthy foods in your diet, it’s important to replace them with healthy alternatives. Replacing dangerous trans fats with healthy fats (such as switching fried chicken for grilled salmon)
                    will make a positive difference to your health. Switching animal fats for refined carbohydrates, though (such as switching your breakfast bacon for a donut), won’t lower your risk for heart disease or improve your mood.</p>

                <p>Read the labels. It’s important to be aware of what’s in your food as manufacturers often hide large amounts of sugar or unhealthy fats in packaged food, even food claiming to be healthy.</p>

                <p>Focus on how you feel after eating. This will help foster healthy new habits and tastes. The healthier the food you eat, the better you’ll feel after a meal. The more junk food you eat, the more likely you are to feel uncomfortable, nauseous,
                    or drained of energy.</p>

                <p>Drink plenty of water. Water helps flush our systems of waste products and toxins, yet many of us go through life dehydrated—causing tiredness, low energy, and headaches. It’s common to mistake thirst for hunger, so staying well hydrated
                    will also help you make healthier food choices.</p>

                <p>Take your time. It’s important to slow down and think about food as nourishment rather than just something to gulp down in between meetings or on the way to pick up the kids. It actually takes a few minutes for your brain to tell your
                    body that it has had enough food, so eat slowly and stop eating before you feel full.</p>

                <p>Eat with others whenever possible. Eating alone, especially in front of the TV or computer, often leads to mindless overeating.</p>

                <p>Limit snack foods in the home. Be careful about the foods you keep at hand. It’s more challenging to eat in moderation if you have unhealthy snacks and treats at the ready. Instead, surround yourself with healthy choices and when you’re
                    ready to reward yourself with a special treat, go out and get it then.</p>

                <p>Control emotional eating. We don’t always eat just to satisfy hunger. Many of us also turn to food to relieve stress or cope with unpleasant emotions such as sadness, loneliness, or boredom. But by learning healthier ways to manage stress
                    and emotions, you can regain control over the food you eat and your feelings.</p>

                <p>Eat breakfast, and eat smaller meals throughout the day. A healthy breakfast can jump-start your metabolism, while eating small, healthy meals keeps your energy up all day.</p>

                <p>Avoid eating late at night. Try to eat dinner earlier and fast for 14-16 hours until breakfast the next morning. Studies suggest that eating only when you’re most active and giving your digestive system a long break each day may help to
                    regulate weight.</p>

                <p>Add more fruit and vegetables to your diet: Fruit and vegetables are low in calories and nutrient dense, which means they are packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fibre. </p>

                <p>Eat a medley of sweet fruit—oranges, mangos, pineapple, grapes—for dessert.</p>

                <p>Swap your usual rice or pasta side dish for a colourful salad.</p>

                <p>Instead of eating processed snack foods, snack on vegetables such as carrots, snow peas, or cherry tomatoes along with a spicy hummus dip or peanut butter.</p>

                <h3>Build Healthy Eating Habits</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Eat a variety of vegetables, especially dark green, red, and orange vegetables (3 or more servings a day).</li>
                    <li>Eat whole-grain, high-fiber breads and cereals (3 to 6 servings a day). </li>
                    <li>Eat a variety of fruits (2 or more servings a day).</li>
                    <li>Reduce or eliminate refined or processed carbohydrates; most of the grains in your diet should be whole grains.</li>
                    <li>Drink fat-free or low-fat milk and eat low-fat dairy products.</li>
                    <li>Choose from a variety of low-fat sources of protein — including eggs, beans, poultry without skin, seafood, lean meats, unsalted nuts, seeds, and soy products. If you eat meat, eat white meat at least four times more often than red
                        meat.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        <p>Stress is how the brain and body respond to any demand. In a dangerous situation, stress signals the body to prepare to face a threat or flee to safety. In these situations, your pulse quickens, you breathe faster, your muscles
                            tense, and your brain uses more oxygen and increases activity—all functions aimed at survival and in response to stress.</p>

                        <p>Sleep is a body-mind state in which we experience sensory detachment from our surroundings. Getting enough sleep is essential for helping a person maintain optimal health and well-being. When it comes to their health, sleep is
                            as vital as regular exercise and eating a balanced diet. Most people have trouble sleeping from time to time because of travel, changes in schedule or lifestyle or stressful situations throughout the day.
