                <h2>FOOD AND NUTRITION</h2>

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
                <p>Food gives our bodies the energy we need to function. Food is also a part of traditions and culture. 
                    This can mean that eating has an emotional component as well. For many people, changing eating habits is very hard. 
                    You may have had certain eating habits for so long that you do not realize they are unhealthy. 
                    Or, your habits have become part of your daily life, so you do not think much about them.
                </p>

                <p>The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace processed food with real food whenever possible. 
                    Eating food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a huge difference to the way you think, look, and feel.
                    To set yourself up for success, try to keep things simple. Eating a healthier diet doesn’t have to be complicated. 
                    Instead of being overly concerned with counting calories, for example, think of your diet in terms of color, variety, and freshness. 
                    Focus on avoiding packaged and processed foods and opting for more fresh ingredients whenever possible.
                </p>

                <p>Prepare more of your own meals. Cooking more meals at home can help you take charge of what you’re eating and better monitor exactly what goes into your food. 
                    You’ll eat fewer calories and avoid the chemical additives, added sugar, and unhealthy fats of packaged and takeout foods that can leave you feeling tired, bloated, and irritable, and exacerbate symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety.
                </p>

                <p>Also, it is important to make the right changes. When cutting back on unhealthy foods in your diet, it’s pertinent to replace them with healthy alternatives.
                    Replacing dangerous trans fats with healthy fats (such as switching fried chicken for grilled salmon) will make a positive difference to your health. 
                    Switching animal fats for refined carbohydrates, though (such as switching your breakfast bacon for a donut), won’t lower your risk for heart disease or improve your mood.
                </p>

                <p>In particular, read labels. It’s important to be aware of what’s in your food as manufacturers often hide large amounts of sugar or unhealthy fats in packaged food, even food claiming to be healthy.</p>

                <p>In addition, focus on how you feel after eating. This will help foster healthy new habits and tastes. 
                    The healthier the food you eat, the better you’ll feel after a meal. 
                    The more junk food you eat, the more likely you are to feel uncomfortable, nauseous, or drained of energy.
                </p>

                <p>Importantly, drink plenty of water. Water helps flush our systems of waste products and toxins, yet many of us go through life dehydrated—causing tiredness, low energy, and headaches. 
                    It’s common to mistake thirst for hunger, so staying well hydrated will also help you make healthier food choices.
                </p>

                <p>Futhermore, take your time. It’s important to slow down and think about food as nourishment rather than just something to gulp down in between meetings or on the way to pick up the kids. 
                    It actually takes a few minutes for your brain to tell your body that it has had enough food, so eat slowly and stop eating before you feel full. Along with this, eat with others whenever possible. 
                    Eating alone, especially in front of the TV or computer, often leads to mindless overeating.
                </p>

                <p>Moreso, control emotional eating. We don’t always eat just to satisfy hunger. Many of us also turn to food to relieve stress or cope with unpleasant emotions such as sadness, loneliness, or boredom. 
                    But by learning healthier ways to manage stress and emotions, you can regain control over the food you eat and your feelings.
                </p>

                <p>As much as possible, limit snack foods in the home. Be careful about the foods you keep at hand. 
                    It’s more challenging to eat in moderation if you have unhealthy snacks and treats at the ready. 
                    Instead, surround yourself with healthy choices and when you’re ready to reward yourself with a special treat, go out and get it then.
                </p>

                <p>Equally important, eat breakfast, and eat smaller meals throughout the day. A healthy breakfast can jumpstart your metabolism, while eating small, healthy meals keeps your energy up all day. 
                    In like manner, avoid eating late at night. Try to eat dinner earlier and fast for 14-16 hours until breakfast the next morning. 
                    Studies suggest that eating only when you’re most active and giving your digestive system a long break each day may help to regulate weight. 
                </p>

                <p>Lastly but not the least, add more fruit and vegetables to your diet: Fruit and vegetables are low in calories and nutrient dense, which means they are packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fibre. 
                    Eat a medley of sweet fruit—oranges, mangos, pineapple, grapes—for dessert.
                    Again, swap your usual rice or pasta side dish for a colourful salad.
                    Instead of eating processed snack foods, snack on vegetables such as carrots, snow peas, or cherry tomatoes along with a spicy hummus dip or peanut butter.
                </p>

                <h3>Build Healthy Eating Habits</h3>

                <p>Eat a variety of vegetables, especially dark green, red, and orange vegetables (3 or more servings a day).</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Eat a variety of fruits (2 or more servings a day).</li>

                    <li>Eat whole-grain, high-fiber breads and cereals (3 to 6 servings a day). Reduce or eliminate refined or processed carbohydrates; most of the grains in your diet should be whole grains.</li>

                    <li>Drink fat-free or low-fat milk and eat low-fat dairy products.</li>

                    <li>Choose from a variety of low-fat sources of protein — including eggs, beans, poultry without skin, seafood, lean meats, unsalted nuts, seeds, and soy products. If you eat meat, eat white meat at least four times more often than red meat.</li>

                    <li>Reduce intake of saturated fats and trans-fats (such as partially hydrogenated oil) as much as possible.</li>

                    <li>Use vegetable oils (like olive or canola oil) instead of solid fats.</li>

                    <li>Reduce daily intake of salt or sodium. Reduce to less than 1,500 mg. per day if you are older than 50, or have hypertension, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.</li>

                    <li>Restrict or eliminate "junk food" — foods that contain refined white flour, solid fats or trans fats, added sugars, and are high in sodium.</li>

                    <li>Restrict or eliminate sodas and other sugar-added drinks that are high in calories and contain few or no nutrients.</li>

                    <li>If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation. Drink only when it doesn't put you or anyone else at risk.</li>

                </ul>

                <p><em>To Lose Weight</em></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce the number of calories you eat daily. Eat smaller portions—don't "upsize" your meals at fast food restaurants.</li>

                    <li>Follow the dietary guidelines above.</li>

                    <li>Eliminate all sugar-added drinks from your diet. You can drink 100% fruit juice, unsweetened, but limit servings to one or two a day. Drink more water.</li>

                    <li>Decrease the amount of time spent in sedentary activities, especially watching television.  Use your screen-free time working on hobbies, house cleaning, yard work, or engaging in fun activities.</li>

                    <li>Get moderate physical activity (such as walking, bicycling, swimming, or using aerobic exercise machines) for 30 to 60 minutes a day, at least five days a week.</li>

                    <li>g exercises at least 2 or 3 days a week.</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Types of fats</h3>

                <p>Fatty acids are the basic chemicals in fat. They may be saturated, polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, or trans fats. These fatty acids differ in their chemical makeup and structure, and in the way in which they affect your blood cholesterol levels.</p>

                <p><em>Saturated fat:</em></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Is used by the liver to manufacture cholesterol</li>

                    <li>Can raise blood cholesterol levels, particularly the LDL ("bad") cholesterol level (this raises your risk for heart attack and stroke)</li>

                    <li>Should make up no more than 10% of your daily calories.</li>

                    <li>Can be found in meats, whole dairy products, butter, cocoa butter, coconut, and palm oils.</li>

                </ul>

                <p><em>Polyunsaturated fat</em></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Don't appear to raise blood cholesterol levels.</li>

                    <li>Examples of polyunsaturated fats include safflower, sunflower, corn, and vegetable oils, and soybean oils.</li>

                </ul>

                <p><em>Monounsaturated fat</em></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Don't seem to raise bad cholesterol levels.</li>

                    <li>They may help boost HDL ("good") cholesterol in the blood. Higher HDL levels have been linked to a lower risk for heart disease.</li>

                    <li>Examples of monounsaturated fats include olive and canola oils.</li>

                </ul>

                <p><em>Trans fats</em></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>These are by-products of hydrogenation. This is a chemical process used to change liquid unsaturated fat to a more solid fat.</li>

                    <li>Trans fats will be found in an ingredients list as a partially hydrogenated oil. Trans fatty acids are similar in structure to saturated fat.</li>

                    <li>They may have a great impact on raising total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels. You should avoid trans fats as much as possible.</li>

                    <li>Examples of trans fats include stick margarine and fats found in commercially prepared cakes, cookies, and snack foods.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                 
                <p><em>Soluble fiber</em></p>

                <p>Soluble fiber is found in foods like oat bran and dried beans. It can lower blood cholesterol in some people.</p>

                <p><em>Insoluble fiber</em></p>

                <p>Insoluble fiber is found in foods like wheat bran. It helps with weight control because it makes you feel full. It does not help lower cholesterol.</p>
