                <h2>DEPRESSION</h2>

                <p>Depression (major depressive disorder) is classified as a mood disorder. It is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a
                    loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home. People experience depression in different ways. It may interfere
                    with your daily work, resulting in lost time and lower productivity. It can also influence relationships and some chronic health conditions.</p>

                <h3>Types and symptoms</h3>

                <p>Depending on the number and severity of symptoms, a depressive episode can be categorized as mild, moderate or severe. A key distinction is also made between depression in people who have or do not have a history of manic episodes. Both
                    types of depression can be chronic (i.e. over an extended period) with relapses, especially if they go untreated.</p>

                <h4>Recurrent depressive disorder:</h4>

                <p>This disorder involves repeated depressive episodes. During these episodes, the person experiences a depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and reduced energy leading to diminished activity for at least two weeks. Many people
                    with this type depression also suffer from anxiety symptoms, disturbed sleep and appetite, and may have feelings of guilt or low self-worth, poor concentration and even symptoms that cannot be explained by a medical diagnosis.</p>

                <p>Depending on the number and severity of symptoms, a depressive episode can be categorized as mild, moderate or severe. An individual with a mild depressive episode will have some difficulty in continuing with ordinary work and social activities
                    but will probably not cease to function completely. During a severe depressive episode, it is unlikely that the sufferer will be able to continue with social, work or domestic activities, except to a limited extent.</p>

                <h4>Bipolar affective disorder:</h4>

                <p>This type of depression typically consists of both manic and depressive episodes separated by periods of normal mood. Manic episodes involve elevated or irritable mood, over-activity, pressure of speech, inflated self-esteem and a decreased
                    need for sleep.</p>

                <h3>DISTINCTION BETWEEN DEPRESSION AND GRIEF</h3>

                <p> The death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss
                    often might describe themselves as being “depressed.” But being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression.</p>

                <p>Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.
                    </li>

                    <li>In grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.</li>

                    <li>In grief, thoughts of death may surface when thinking of or fantasizing about “joining” the deceased loved one. In major depression, thoughts are focused on ending one’s life due to feeling worthless or undeserving of living or being
                        unable to cope with the pain of depression.
                    </li>

                    <li>Grief and depression can co-exist. For some people, the death of a loved one, losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression. When grief and depression co-occur, the grief is more severe
                        and lasts longer than grief without depression.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <h3>RISK FACTORS FOR DEPRESSION</h3>

                <p>Depression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances. Several factors can play a role in depression:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Biochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.
                    </li>

                    <li>Genetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.</li>

                    <li>Personality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.</li>

                    <li>Environmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.</li>

                    <li>Medical conditions: Certain conditions may put you at higher risk, such as chronic illness, insomnia, chronic pain, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</li>

                    <li>Drug use: A history of drug or alcohol misuse can put you at risk.</li>

                    <li>Early childhood trauma: Some events affect the way your body reacts to fear and stressful situations.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>SYMPTOMS</h3>

                <p>For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people may feel generally miserable or
                    unhappy without really knowing why.</p>

                <p>Men may experience symptoms related to their:</p>

                    <li>Suicidal thinking or feelings, especially in older men</li>

                <h3>COMPLICATIONS </h3>

                <p>Depression is a serious disorder that can take a terrible toll on you and your family. It often gets worse if it isn't treated, resulting in emotional, behavioral and health problems that affect every area of your life. Examples of complications
                    associated with depression include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Excess weight or obesity, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes</li>

                    <li>Pain or physical illness</li>

                    <li>Alcohol or drug misuse</li>

                    <li>Family conflicts, relationship difficulties, and work or school problems</li>

                    <li>Social isolation</li>

                    <li>Suicidal feelings, suicide attempts or suicide</li>

                    <li>Self-mutilation, such as cutting one's self</li>

                    <li>Premature death from medical conditions.</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>PREVENTION</h3>

                <p>Depression isn’t generally considered to be preventable. It’s hard to recognize what causes it, which means preventing it is more difficult. But once you’ve experienced a depressive episode, you may be better prepared to prevent a future
                    episode by learning which lifestyle changes and treatments are helpful.</p>

                <p>Techniques that may help include:</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>Take steps to control stress, to increase your resilience and boost your self-esteem.</li>

                    <li>Reach out to family and friends, especially in times of crisis, to help you weather rough spells.
                    </li>

                    <li>Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent depression from worsening.</li>

                    <li>Regular exercise</li>

                    <li>Getting plenty of sleep</li>

                    <li>Maintaining treatments</li>

                    <li>Reducing stress</li>

                    <li>Building strong relationships with others</li>

                    <li>Cut back on social media</li>

                    <li>Consider getting long-term maintenance treatment to help prevent a relapse of symptoms.</li>

                    <li>Limit alcohol and drug use</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>TREATMENT</h3>

                <p>Depression is treatable, and managing symptoms usually involves three components:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Support: This can range from discussing practical solutions and possible causes to educating family members.</li>

                    <li>Psychotherapy: Also known as talking therapy, some options include one-to-one counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).</li>

                    <li>Drug treatment: A doctor may prescribe antidepressants.</li>

                </ul>
