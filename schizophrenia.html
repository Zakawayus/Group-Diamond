                <h2>SCHIZOPHRENIA</h2>

                <p>Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe mental disorder that affects the way a person thinks, acts, expresses emotions, perceives reality, and relates to others. Though schizophrenia isn’t as common as other major mental illnesses, it can be
                    the most chronic and disabling. Schizophrenia involves psychosis, a type of mental illness in which a person can’t tell what’s real from what’s imagined. It involves distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of
                    self and behaviour. At times, people with psychotic disorders lose touch with reality. The world may seem like a jumble of confusing thoughts, images, and sounds. People with schizophrenia often have problems doing well in society,
                    at work, at school, and in relationships. They might feel frightened and withdrawn, and could appear to have lost touch with reality. This lifelong disease can’t be cured but can be controlled with proper treatment.
                </p>

                <h3>SYMPTOMS</h3>

                <p>In men, schizophrenia symptoms typically start in the early to mid-20s. In women, symptoms typically begin in the late 20s. It's uncommon for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and rare for those older than age 45. The period
                    when symptoms first start and before full psychosis is called the prodromal period. It can last days, weeks, or even years. It can be hard to spot because there’s usually no specific trigger.
                </p>

                <p>The symptoms of schizophrenia may be divided into the following 4 domains:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Positive symptoms - Psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, which are usually auditory; delusions; catatonia and disorganized speech and behavior</li>

                    <li>Negative symptoms - Lack of emotion or a limited range of emotions, Withdrawal from family, friends, and social activities, Less energy, Speaking less, Lack of motivation, Loss of pleasure or interest in life, Poor hygiene and grooming
                        habits.
                    </li>

                    <li>Cognitive symptoms - Understanding information and using it to make decisions (a doctor might call this poor executive functioning), Focusing or paying attention, Using their information immediately after learning it (this is called
                        working memory), Recognizing that they have any of these problems.</li>

                    <li>Mood symptoms - Patients often seem cheerful or sad in a way that is difficult to understand; they often are depressed</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>CAUSES</h3>

                <p>Research has not identified one single factor. It is thought that an interaction between genes and a range of environmental factors may cause schizophrenia. Psychosocial factors, problems with certain naturally occurring brain chemicals,
                    including neurotransmitters called dopamine and glutamate, may contribute to schizophrenia. Neuroimaging studies show differences in the brain structure and central nervous system of people with schizophrenia. While researchers aren't
                    certain about the significance of these changes, they indicate that schizophrenia is a brain disease.</p>

                <h3>RISK FACTORS</h3>

                <p>Although the precise cause of schizophrenia isn't known, certain factors seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering schizophrenia, including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Having a family history of schizophrenia</li>

                    <li>Some pregnancy and birth complications, such as malnutrition or exposure to toxins or viruses that may impact brain development</li>

                    <li>Taking mind-altering (psychoactive or psychotropic) drugs during teen years and young adulthood.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <h3>COMPLICATIONS</h3>

                <p>Left untreated, schizophrenia can result in severe problems that affect every area of life. Complications that schizophrenia may cause or be associated with include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Suicide, suicide attempts and thoughts of suicide</li>

                    <li>Anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</li>

                    <li>Depression</li>

                    <li>Abuse of alcohol or other drugs, including nicotine</li>

                    <li>Inability to work or attend school</li>

                    <li>Financial problems and homelessness</li>

                    <li>Social isolation</li>

                    <li>Health and medical problems</li>

                    <li>Being victimized</li>

                    <li>Aggressive behavior, although it's uncommon</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>PREVENTION</h3>

                <p>There's no sure way to prevent schizophrenia, but sticking with the treatment plan can help prevent relapses or worsening of symptoms. In addition, researchers hope that learning more about risk factors for schizophrenia may lead to earlier
                    diagnosis and treatment.</p>

                <h3>TREATMENT</h3>

                <p>Schizophrenia requires lifelong treatment, even when symptoms have subsided. Treatment with Electro convulsive therapy (ECT), medications and psychosocial therapy can help manage the condition. In some cases, hospitalization may be needed.
