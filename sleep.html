                <h2>Sleep</h2>

                <p>Sleep is a body-mind state in which we experience sensory detachment from our surroundings. Getting enough sleep is essential for helping a person maintain optimal health and well-being. When it comes to their health, sleep is as vital
                    as regular exercise and eating a balanced diet. Most people have trouble sleeping from time to time because of travel, changes in schedule or lifestyle or stressful situations throughout the day. Lack of sleep can affect emotional
                    and physical health. There are many tips for how to get enough sleep that don’t involve medication or seeing a sleep specialist. Diet modifications, yoga, reducing screen time before bed and bedroom preparation are all important factors
                    in getting to and staying asleep. Missing out on your fair share of high-quality sleep can boost your risk for depression, becoming overweight or obese, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, memory and concentration
                    problems and can even make you look older.</p>

                <h3>REMEDIES TO BETTER SLEEP.</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Know when to watch the clock. It’s normal to take 10 to 20 minutes to fall asleep after lights-out. If you’re dropping off within five minutes or find yourself falling asleep during the day, you’re likely not getting enough sleep.
                        But if you’re still tossing and turning after 20 to 30 minutes, get up. Go read a book or listen to relaxing music until you feel sleepy, and then return to your bed. It’s one way to train your mind to associate your bed with sleeping
                        instead of struggling, research has shown.</li>

                    <li>Don’t underestimate caffeine: It takes nearly six hours for half of the caffeine from your favourite coffee, tea or cola to exit the body. Caffeine too late in the day can cause lighter, more disturbed sleep—or keep you from sleeping
                        at all, researchers have found. In a 2013 study, researchers learned that consuming 400 mg of caffeine (the amount in two to three cups of coffee or one 20-ounce coffee drink) six hours before bed cut total sleeping time by more
                        than an hour.</li>

                    <li>Avoid Alcohol: An estimated 10% of older adults use alcohol to overcome insomnia. It seems to help ... but is actually harmful. A recent review confirms that an alcoholic drink before bed can help you fall asleep faster. But it reduces
                        the amount of time you spend in deeper sleep stages that affect memory, concentration and even physical coordination.</li>

                    <li>Trade sleep aids for sleep hygiene: Try upgrading your sleep habits instead of relying on drugstore sleep remedies which often contain antihistamines that can cause dangerous daytime drowsiness (and can mask a fixable sleep problem).</li>

                    <li>A bedtime ritual: Put on your pajamas. Relax. Avoid stressful activities, like working or having tense discussions.</li>

                    <li>A peaceful bedroom: Instead, keep bedroom room free of distracting clutter and constant reminders of all the things you need to do.</li>

                    <li>No electronics at least 30 minutes before bed: Darkness in the evening helps our brains prepare for sleep. Staring at the light from your phone, computer or television throws off your brain’s internal clock.</li>

                    <li>Rule out health problems: Conditions like Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and obstructive sleep apnea can rob you of quality sleep. If you have heartburn, talk with your doctor about reflux treatments that can ease nighttime
                        reflux. You may have sleep apnea if you snore loudly and gasp or seem to choke at night as tissue in your throat blocks your airways, causing you to momentarily stop breathing. If you share a bedroom, ask, “Do I snore loudly or
                        gasp for breath at night?” Treatments, including weight loss and wearing a pressurized mask for better breathing, can reverse apnea.</li>

                    <li>Consult with a sleep expert: If you’re struggling with lack of sleep, talk to your health care provider. However, If you can’t resolve your problems with your health care provider’s help, consider visiting a sleep specialist. This
                        expert can help figure out if such problems as restless legs syndrome or chronic pain are keeping you from sleeping well.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>BENEFITS OF SLEEP</h3>

                <p>The following are some of the many benefits associated with a good night’s rest.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Better productivity and concentration</li>
                    <li>Greater athletic performance</li>
                    <li>Preventing depression</li>
                    <li>Stronger immune system</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>SLEEP NEEDS</h3>

                <p>Sleep needs vary from person to person, depending on their age. As a person ages, they typically require less sleep to function properly. According to the CDC, the breakdown is as follows:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Newborns (0–3 months): 14–17 hours</li>
                    <li>Infants (4–12 months): 12–16 hours</li>
                    <li>Toddler (1–2 years): 11–14 hours</li>
                    <li>Preschool (3–5 years): 10–13 hours</li>
                    <li>School age (6–12 years): 9–12 hours</li>
                    <li>Teen (13–18 years): 8–10 hours</li>
                    <li>Adult (18–60 years): 7-plus hours</li>
                    <li>Adult (61–64 years): 7–9 hours</li>
                    <li>Adult (65+ years): 7–8 hours</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As well as the number of hours, the quality of sleep is also important. Signs of poor sleep quality include </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Waking in the middle of the night.</li>
                    <li>Still not feeling rested after an adequate number of hours sleep.</li>
                </ul>
