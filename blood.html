                <h2>BLOOD GROUP COMPATIBILITY</h2>

                <p>Blood group is the classification of blood-based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of Red Blood Cells (RBCs). These antigens may be proteins, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, or glycolipids, depending
                    on the Blood Group System.</p>

                <p>Blood types are inherited and represent contributions from both parents. A total of 32 human blood group systems have been recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT).</p>

                <p>The two most important ones are ABO and the RhD antigen; they determine someone’s blood type (A, B, AB and O, with + and – denoting RhD status)</p>

                <h3>Origin of Blood Group</h3>

                <p>The two most significant blood group systems were discovered by Karl Landsteiner during early experiments with blood transfusion: the ABO group in 1901 in co-operation with Alexander S. Wiener the Rhesus group in 1937. The ABO system is
                    the most important blood-group system in human blood transfusion. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually immunoglobulin M, abbreviated IgM, antibodies. ABO IgM antibodies are produced in the first years of life by
                    sensitization to environmental substances such as food, bacteria, and viruses.</p>

                <h3>RED BLOOD CELL COMPATIBILITY</h3>


                <p>Blood Group AB: individuals have both A and B antigens on the surface of their RBCs and their blood plasma do not contain any antibodies against either A or B antigen. Therefore, an individual with type AB blood can receive blood from
                    any group (with AB being preferable), but cannot donate blood to any group other than AB. They are known as Universal recipients.
                </p>

                <p>Blood Group A: individuals have the A antigen on the surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing IgM antibodies against the B antigen. Therefore, a group A individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups A or O (with
                    A being preferable) and can donate blood to individuals with type A or AB.</p>

                <p>Blood Group B: individuals have the B antigen on the surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing IgM antibodies against the A antigen. Therefore, a group B individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups B or O (with
                    B being preferable) and can donate blood to individuals with type B or AB.</p>

                <p>Blood Group O: individuals do not have either A or B antigens on the surface of their RBCs and their blood serum contains IgM anti-A & anti-B antibodies against the A and B blood group antigens. Therefore, a group O individual can receive
                    blood only from a group O individual but can donate blood to individuals of any ABO blood group (i.e., A, B, O or AB). They are known as universal donors.</p>

                <p>A person with one blood type or group can produce antibodies against the other. For instance, a person with blood type A makes antibodies against blood type B. If this person is given blood of type B, his or her antibodies will bind to
                    the antigens on the type B blood cells cause the blood to clump together. </p>

                <h3>RHESUS INCOMPATIBILITY</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Rhesus Factor is a type of protein found on red blood cells. If you have Rh factor, you’re Rh-positive. If you don’t have it, you’re Rh-negative. Rh factor is inherited (passed from parents to children through the genes). Most people
                        are Rh-positive. Whether you have Rh factor doesn’t affect your general health. However, it can cause problems during pregnancy.</li>
                    <li>Rh Incompatibility is a condition that occurs during pregnancy if a woman has Rh-negative blood and her baby has Rh-positive blood.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Rh Blood Group System</h3>

                <p>The Rh system is the second most significant blood-group system. The Rh factor causes problems when an Rh-negative person’s blood comes in contact with Rh-positive blood. If this happens, the person with Rh-negative blood may become sensitized.
                    This means he or she produces antibodies that fight against the Rh factor as if it were a harmful substance. Once formed, these antibodies do not go away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These antibodies can attack and break down fetal Rh-positive red blood cells. This causes hemolytic anaemia which can lead to a serious illness, brain damage, or even death of the fetus or newborn. Hemolytic anaemia is a condition in which red blood cells
                    are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. Without enough red blood cells, a baby won’t get enough oxygen. This can lead to serious problems.
                </p>

                <h3>When does Sensitization occur?</h3>

                <p>Knowing your blood type is important during pregnancy. If the mother is Rh- and the father is Rh+, the fetus can either inherit the Rhesus gene from either the father or mother. If the mother and the father are both Rh- there will be no
                    chance the fetus will be Rh+ and no risk to the mother that she will be sensitized. If the mother is Rh+ and the father is Rh-, sensitization will not occur. However, an Rh- woman can become sensitized if she is pregnant with a Rh+
                    fetus. If a pregnant woman is Rh- her fetus can only be Rh+ only if the father is Rh+. These antibodies usually don’t cause problems during a first pregnancy. This is because the baby often is born before many of the antibodies develop.
                    However, the antibodies stay in the body once they have formed. </p>

                <p>Thus, Rh incompatibility is more likely to cause problems in second or later pregnancies (if the baby is Rh-positive). To curb the complications associated with this, pregnant women should always meet regularly with obstetricians and human
                    anti-D or immunoglobulin should be administered to those with the complications.</p>

                <h3>GENOTYPE COMPATIBILITY</h3>

                <p>Genotype can be simply defined as the genetic constitution of an individual organism.</p>

                <p>The problem to avoid with genotype compatibility for intending couples is <a href="./sickle-cell.html">sickle cell disease</a> (a recessive disorder)—a very serious medical condition with high prevalence rates in Africa south of the Sahara.</p>
                <p>Si<a href="./sickle-cell.html">sickle cell disease</a> is a chronic condition in which mutated haemoglobin distorts red blood cells into a crescent shape, causing the cells to become stuck in the capillaries. This leads to disrupted blood
                    flow and the death of tissues.</p>

                <h3>Types of Genotype</h3>

                <p>While there is no cure for hypertension currently, it can be prevented and successfully managed with the following steps.</p>

                <p>The genotypes in humans are AA, AS, AC, SS. AC is rare whereas AS and SS are abnormal.</p>
