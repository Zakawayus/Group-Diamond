                <h2>PERSONAL HYGIENE</h2>

                <p>Hygiene is a series of practices performed to preserve health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), "Hygiene refers to conditions and practices that help to maintain health and prevent the spread of diseases. " Personal hygiene
                    refers to maintaining the body's cleanliness. This practice includes bathing, washing your hands, brushing your teeth, and more.
                </p>

                <p>Every day, you come into contact with millions of outside germs and viruses. They can linger on your body, and in some cases, they may make you sick. Personal hygiene practices can help you and the people around you prevent illnesses.
                    They can also help you feel good about your appearance.
                </p>

                <h3>Types of personal hygiene</h3>

                <!--<aside>
                    <b> Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Necessitatibus possimus omnis error hic distinctio in. </b>
                </aside> -->

                <p>Each person’s idea of personal hygiene differs. These main categories are a useful place to start for building good hygiene habits:</p>

                <!-- <div class="figure">
                    <img src="./images/logo.jpeg" alt="">
                </div> -->

                <p><em>Toilet hygiene</em></p>

                <p>Wash your hands after you use the restroom. Scrub with soap for 20 to 30 seconds, and be sure to clean between your fingers, on the back of your hands, and under your nails. Rinse with warm water, and dry with a clean towel. If you don’t
                    have running water or soap, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer will also work. Use one that’s at least 60 percent alcohol.

                </p>

                <p><em>Shower hygiene</em></p>

                <p>Personal preference may dictate how often you wish to shower, but most people will benefit from a rinse at least every other day. Showering with soap helps rinse away dead skin cells, bacteria, and oils. You should also wash your hair
                    at least twice a week. Shampooing your hair and scalp helps remove skin buildup and protects against oily residues that can irritate your skin.
                </p>

                <p><em>Nail hygiene</em></p>

                <p>Trim your nails regularly to keep them short and clean. Brush under them with a nail brush or washcloth to rinse away buildup, dirt, and germs. Tidying your nails helps you prevent spreading germs into your mouth and other body openings.
                    You should also avoid biting your nails.
                </p>

                <p><em>Teeth hygiene</em></p>

                <p>
                    Good dental hygiene is about more than just pearly white teeth. Caring for your teeth and gums is a smart way to prevent gum diseases and cavities. Brush at least twice a day for 2 minutes. Aim to brush after you wake up and before bed. If you can, brush
                    after every meal, too. Floss between your teeth daily, and ask your dentist about using an antibacterial mouthwash.
                </p>

                <p><em>Sickness hygiene</em></p>

                <p>
                    If you’re not feeling well, you should take steps to keep from spreading germs to others. This includes covering your mouth and nose when sneezing, wiping down shared surfaces with an antibacterial wipe, and not sharing any utensils or electronics. Also,
                    immediately throw away any soiled tissues.
                </p>

                <p><em>Hands hygiene</em></p>

                <p>Germs on your hands can easily enter your body through your mouth, nose, eyes, or ears. Wash your hands:
                    <ul>
                        <li>when you handle food</li>

                        <li>before you eat</li>

                        <li>if you handle garbage</li>

                        <li>when you sneeze</li>

                        <li>any time you touch an animal</li>

                        <li>after changing a baby’s diaper, helping someone clean themselves, or when cleaning a cut or wound.</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Side effects of poor personal hygiene</h3>

                <p>Good personal hygiene habits are directly related to less illnesses and better health. Poor personal hygiene habits, however, can lead to some minor side effects, like body odor and greasy skin. They can also lead to more troublesome or
                    even serious issues. For example, if you don’t wash your hands frequently, you can easily transfer germs and bacteria to your mouth or eyes. This can lead to any number of issues, from stomach viruses to pink eye. Not brushing your
                    teeth can lead to tooth issues and plaque buildup. Poor dental care is also a risk factor for several serious health issues, including heart disease. Poor hygiene habits can also affect your self-esteem. Looking and feeling presentable
                    can give you a confidence boost and a sense of pride in your appearance. Other conditions may be prevented or the risk minimized by practicing good personal hygiene. These are some examples:

                <h2> FOOD HYGIENE</h2>

                <p>The tips for food safety start with selecting fresh foods to preserve the cooked one. Some of the most common diseases such as food poisoning, cancers, and flu are derived from consumption of contaminated and unsafe foods. According to
                    WHO, only a small number of factors related to food handling are responsible for a large proportion of foodborne disease episodes everywhere. Common errors include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Preparation of food several hours prior to consumption, combined with its storage at temperatures which favour growth of pathogenic bacteria and/or formation of toxins;</li>

                    <li>Insufficient cooking or reheating of food to reduce or eliminate pathogens;</li>

                    <li>Cross contamination; and</li>

                    <li>People with poor personal hygiene handling the food.</li>

                </ul>

                <p><strong>The Ten Golden Rules respond to these errors, offering advice that can reduce the risk that foodborne pathogens will be able to contaminate, to survive or to multiply.</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Choose foods processed for safety: Purchasing fresh foods is impossible. Certain foods eaten raw, such as lettuce need thorough washing. Fruits should be peeled before eating. Frozen foods to thaw then freeze again are unsafe.</li>

                    <li>Cook food thoroughly: Thorough cooking means ensuring that the temperature of all parts of the food must reach at least 70 °C.</li>

                    <li>Eat cooked foods immediately: Eat cooked foods just as soon as they come off the heat since the longer the wait, the greater the risk of microbe proliferation.</li>

                    <li>Store cooked foods carefully: If you plan to store foods for more than four or five hours, be sure to store them under either hot (near or above 60 °C) or cool (near or below 10 °C) conditions. Foods for infants should preferably not
                        be stored at all.</li>

                    <li>Reheat cooked foods thoroughly: This is your best protection against microbes that may have developed during storage. Once again, thorough reheating means that all parts of the food must reach at least 70 °C.</li>

                    <li>Avoid contact between raw foods and cooked foods: Safely cooked food can become contaminated through even the slightest contact with raw food, directly or subtly (by using the same unwashed cutting board and knife, for instance).</li>

                    <li>Wash hands repeatedly: Wash hands thoroughly before you start preparing food and after every interruption. If you have an infection on your hand, be sure to bandage or cover it before preparing food.</li>

                    <li>Keep all kitchen surfaces meticulously clean: Since foods are so easily contaminated, any surface used for food preparation must be kept absolutely clean. Clothes that come into contact with dishes and utensils should be changed frequently
                        and boiled before reuse.</li>

                    <li>Protect foods from insects, rodents, and other animals: Storing foods in closed containers is your best protection. Clothes that cover the cooked foods need to be washed before reuse.</li>

                    <li>Use safe water: Safe water is just as important for food preparation as for drinking. Boil water before adding it to food or making ice for drinks. Be especially careful with any water used to prepare an infant's meal.</li>

                </ol>

                        <p>Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A coronavirus identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19.

                        <p>Because the source of long-term stress is more constant than acute stress, the body never receives a clear signal to return to normal functioning. With chronic stress, those same lifesaving reactions in the body can disturb the
                            immune, digestive, cardiovascular, sleep, and reproductive systems. Some people may experience mainly digestive symptoms, while others may have headaches, sleeplessness, sadness, anger, or irritability. Over time, continued
                            strain on your body from stress may contribute to serious health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other illnesses, including mental disorders such as depression or anxiety.
