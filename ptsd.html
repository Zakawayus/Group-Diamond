                <h2>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (P.T.S.D)</h2>

                <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder can occur in a person who has witnessed an extraordinarily terrifying and potentially deadly event. After the traumatic event, the person re-experiences all or some of it through dreams or waking recollections
                    and responds defensively to these flashbacks. New behaviors develop related to the trauma, such as sleep difficulties, hyper-vigilance, thinking difficulties, severe startle response, and agitation. People with P.T.S.D have intense,
                    disturbing thoughts and feelings related to their experience that last long after the traumatic event has ended. They may relive the event through flashbacks or nightmares; they may feel sadness, fear or anger; and they may feel detached
                    or estranged from other people. People with P.T.S.D may avoid situations or people that remind them of the traumatic event, and they may have strong negative reactions to something as ordinary as a loud noise or an accidental touch.

                </p>

                <h3>SYMPTOMS</h3>
                <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms cause significant problems in social or work situations and in relationships.
                    They can also interfere with your ability to go about your normal daily tasks. PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional
                    reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Intrusion: Intrusive thoughts such as repeated, involuntary memories; distressing dreams; or flashbacks of the traumatic event. Flashbacks may be so vivid that people feel they are re-living the traumatic experience or seeing it before
                        their eyes.</li>
                    <li> Avoidance: Avoiding reminders of the traumatic event may include avoiding people, places, activities, objects and situations that may trigger distressing memories. People may try to avoid remembering or thinking about the traumatic
                        event. They may resist talking about what happened or how they feel about it.</li>
                    <li>Negative changes in thinking and mood: Symptoms of negative changes in thinking and mood may include: Negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world, Hopelessness about the future, Memory problems, including not remembering
                        important aspects of the traumatic event, Difficulty maintaining close relationships, Feeling detached from family and friends, Lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed, Difficulty experiencing positive emotions, Feeling
                        emotionally numb</li>
                    <li>Changes in physical and emotional reactions: Symptoms of changes in physical and emotional reactions (also called arousal symptoms) may include: Being easily startled or frightened, Always being on guard for danger, Self-destructive
                        behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast, Trouble sleeping, Trouble concentrating, Irritability, angry outbursts or aggressive behavior, Overwhelming guilt or shame.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>RISK FACTORS</h3>

                <p>People of all ages can have post-traumatic stress disorder. However, some factors may make you more likely to develop PTSD after a traumatic event, such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Experiencing intense or long-lasting trauma </li>
                    <li>Having experienced other trauma earlier in life, such as childhood abuse </li>
                    <li>Having a job that increases your risk of being exposed to traumatic events, such as military personnel and first responders </li>
                    <li>Having other mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression </li>
                    <li>Having problems with substance misuse, such as excess drinking or drug use </li>
                    <li>Lacking a good support system of family and friends </li>
                    <li>Having blood relatives with mental health problems, including anxiety or depression</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>KINDS OF TRAUMATIC EVENTS</h3>
                <p>The most common events leading to the development of PTSD include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Combat exposure</li>
                    <li>Childhood physical abuse</li>
                    <li>Sexual violence</li>
                    <li>Physical assault</li>
                    <li>Being threatened with a weapon</li>
                    <li>An accident</li>
                    <li>Fire,</li>
                    <li>Natural disaster,</li>
                    <li>mugging,</li>
                    <li>robbery,</li>
                    <li>plane crash,</li>
                    <li>torture</li>
                    <li>kidnapping,</li>
                    <li>life-threatening medical diagnosis,</li>
                    <li>terrorist attack, and other extreme or life-threatening events.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>COMPLICATIONS</h3>
                <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder can disrupt your whole life ― your job, your relationships, your health and your enjoyment of everyday activities. Having PTSD may also increase your risk of other mental health problems, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Depression and anxiety</li>
                    <li>Issues with drugs or alcohol use</li>
                    <li>Eating disorders</li>
                    <li>Suicidal thoughts and actions</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>PREVENTION</h3>

                <p>After surviving a traumatic event, many people have PTSD-like symptoms at first, such as being unable to stop thinking about what's happened. Fear, anxiety, anger, depression, guilt — all are common reactions to trauma. Getting timely
                    help and support may prevent normal stress reactions from getting worse and developing into PTSD. This may mean turning to family and friends who will listen and offer comfort. It may mean seeking out a mental health professional for
                    a brief course of therapy. Some people may also find it helpful to turn to their faith community. Support from others also may help prevent you from turning to unhealthy coping methods, such as misuse of alcohol or drugs.
