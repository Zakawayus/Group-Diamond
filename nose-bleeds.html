                <h3>Nosebleeds</h3>
                <p>A nosebleed is the loss of blood from the tissue that lines the inside of your nose. Nosebleeds (also called epistaxis) are common. Some 60% of people will have at least one nosebleed in their lifetime. The location of the nose in the
                    middle of the face and the large number of blood vessels close to the surface in the lining of your nose make it an easy target for injury and nosebleeds. Although seeing blood coming out of your noise can be alarming, most nosebleeds
                    are not serious and can be managed at home. Some, however, should be checked by your doctor. For instance, if you have frequent nosebleeds, see your doctor. This could be an early sign of other medical problems that needs to be investigated.
                    A few nosebleeds start in the back of the nose. These nosebleeds usually involve large blood vessels, result in heavy bleeding and can be dangerous. You will need medical attention for this type of bleed, especially if the bleeding
                    occurs after an injury and the bleeding hasn’t stopped after 20 minutes of following the instructions below.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sit upright and lean forward. By remaining upright, you reduce blood pressure in the veins of your nose. This discourages further bleeding. Sitting forward will help you avoid swallowing blood, which can irritate your stomach. </li>
                    <li>Pinch your nose. Use your thumb and index finger to pinch your nostrils shut. Breathe through your mouth. Continue to pinch for 10 to 15 minutes. Pinching sends pressure to the bleeding point on the nasal septum and often stops the
                        flow of blood.</li>
                    <li>Hold the nose for at least 5 minutes. Then check to see if the bleeding has stopped. If it hasn’t stopped, gently squeeze for another 10 minutes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Call the doctor or go to an emergency room if: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The bleeding hasn’t stopped after 15 to 20 minutes or keeps starting again.</li>
                    <li>The bleeding is fast and there’s a lot of blood.</li>
                    <li>The bleeding is from an injury to your nose or face.</li>
                    <li>You feel faint or weak.</li>
                    <li>The nosebleed follows an accident, a fall or an injury to your head, including a punch in the face that may have broken your nose</li>
                </ul>

                        <p>A burn is tissue damage that results from scalding, overexposure to the sun or other radiation, contact with flames, chemicals or electricity, or smoke inhalation. Grabbing a hot pot or splashing boiling water on your skin are
                            just two common causes of burns around the house. When you get a burn, first check to see which type it is. Some are more serious than others.</p>

                        <p>Blood group is the classification of blood-based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of Red Blood Cells (RBCs). These antigens may be proteins, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, or glycolipids,

                        <p>Most cuts and grazes are minor and can be easily treated at home. Stopping the bleeding, cleaning the wound thoroughly and covering it with a plaster or dressing is usually all that's needed. Minor wounds should start to heal within
                            a few days.</p>
