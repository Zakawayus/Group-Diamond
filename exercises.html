                <h2>EXERCISES</h2>

                <p>Whether people engage in light exercise, such as going for a walk, or high intensity activities, for example, uphill cycling or weight training, regular exercise provides a huge range of benefits for the body and mind. Exercise is any
                    bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. </p>

                <h3>TYPES AND BENEFITS OF EXERCISE</h3>

                <h4>AEROBIC EXERCISE</h4>

                <p>Aerobic exercise aims to improve how the body uses oxygen. Most aerobic exercise takes place at average levels of intensity over longer periods. An aerobic exercise session involves warming up, exercising for at least 20 minutes, and then
                    cooling down. Aerobic exercise mostly uses large muscle groups. Examples of aerobic exercise include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Running</li>
                    <li>Cycling</li>
                    <li>Swimming</li>
                    <li>Rowing</li>
                    <li>Hiking</li>
                    <li>Dancing</li>
                    <li>Playing tennis</li>
                    <li>Brisk Walking</li>
                    <li>Continuos Training</li>
                    <li>Skipping rope etc</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Aerobic exercise provides the following benefits:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Improves muscle strength in the lungs, heart, and whole body</li>
                    <li>Stimulates bone growth and reduces the risk of osteoporosis when at high intensity</li>
                    <li>Improves sleep hygiene</li>
                    <li>Enhances stamina by increasing the body’s ability to store energy molecules, such as fats and carbohydrates, within muscle.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>ANAEROBIC EXERCISE</h4>

                <p>Anaerobic exercise does not use oxygen for energy. People use this type of exercise to build power, strength, and muscle mass. These exercises are high-intensity activities that should last no longer than around 2 minutes. While all exercise
                    benefits the heart and lungs, anaerobic exercise provides fewer benefits for cardiovascular health than aerobic exercise and uses fewer calories. However, it is more effective than aerobic exercise for building muscle and improving
                    strength. Increasing muscle mass causes the body to burn more fat, even when resting. Anaerobic exercises include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Weightlifting</li>
                    <li>Sprinting</li>
                    <li>Intensive and fast skipping with a rope</li>
                    <li>Interval training</li>
                    <li>Isometrics</li>
                    <li>Any rapid burst of intense activity.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>AGILITY TRAINING</h4>

                <p>Agility training aims to improve a person’s ability to maintain control while speeding up, slowing down, and changing direction. In tennis, for example, agility training helps a player maintain control over their court positioning through
                    good recovery after each shot. People who take part in sports that heavily rely on positioning, coordination, speed, and balance need to engage in agility training regularly. The following sports are examples of ones that require agility:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tennis</li>
                    <li>American football</li>
                    <li>Hockey</li>
                    <li>Badminton</li>
                    <li>Volleyball</li>
                    <li>Basketball</li>
                    <li>Football</li>
                    <li>Martial arts</li>
                    <li>Boxing</li>
                    <li>Wrestling</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>FLEXIBILITY EXERCISES</h4>

                <p>These stretch and lengthen muscles. Activities such as stretching help to improve joint flexibility and keep muscles limber. The goal is to improve the range of motion which can reduce the chance of injury. Some exercises combine stretching,
                    muscle conditioning, and balance training. A popular and effective example is yoga. Yoga movements improve balance, flexibility, posture, and circulation. Pilates is another stretching option that promotes flexibility and core strength.
                    Tai chi is also an effective option for exercise that promotes calm stretching rather than intensity.</p>

                <h4>NOTE:</h4>

                <ol>
                    <li>Exercise is sometimes a gradual learning curve. A person should spread sessions across the week and scale up the intensity slowly.</li>
                    <li>It is important for people to ensure they drink plenty of water during and after exercise. Checking with a doctor is a good precaution to take if someone has a health condition or injury that could impact exercise levels, or that exercise
                        could make worse.</li>
                    <li>While a combination of aerobic and anaerobic exercise provides the most benefit, any exercise is better than none for people who currently have an inactive lifestyle.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>IMPORTANCE OF EXERCISE</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li> <b> Exercise lowers blood pressure:</b> <br> Exercise works like beta-blocker medication to slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure (at rest and also when exercising). High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease
                    </li>
                    <li> <b> Exercise is key to weight control:</b> Especially when combined with a smart diet, being physically active is an essential component for losing weight and even more important for keeping it off, Stewart says—which in turn helps
                        optimize heart health. Being overweight puts stress on the heart and is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b> Exercise helps strengthen muscles:</b> A combination of aerobic workouts (which, depending on your fitness level, can include walking, running, swimming, and other vigorous heart-pumping exercise) and strength training (weight
                        lifting, resistance training) is considered best for heart health. These exercises improve the muscles’ ability to draw oxygen from the circulating blood. That reduces the need for the heart—a muscular organ itself—to work harder
                        to pump more blood to the muscles, whatever your age.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b> Exercise can help you quit smoking: </b> As smokers become fit, they often quit. And people who are fit in the first place are less likely to ever start smoking, which is one of the top risk factors for heart disease because it
                        damages the structure and function of blood vessels.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b> Exercise lowers stress:</b> Stress hormones can put an extra burden on the heart. Exercise—whether aerobic (like running), resistance-oriented (like weight training) or flexibility-focused (like yoga)—can help you relax and ease
                        stress.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b> Exercise reduces inflammation:</b> With regular exercise, chronic inflammation is reduced as the body adapts to the challenge of exercise on many bodily systems. This is an important factor for reducing the adverse effects of many
                        of the diseases just mentioned.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T EXERCISE?</h3>

                <p>Anyone with a no-exercise/sedentary lifestyle has increased risk of the following health problems:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
                    <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
                    <li>Cancer</li>
                    <li>Osteoporosis</li>
                    <li>Premature death from all causes, including the complications of being overweight and obesity.</li>
                </ul>

                        <p>A sprain is a stretch or tear of a ligament, the tough tissue that connects bones and supports the joints. You’re most likely to get a sprain in the wrist or ankle. Sprains cause pain, bruising, and swelling. You may have trouble moving
                            the joint.</p>
                        <p>A strain is an injury to a muscle or tendon, the thick tissue that attaches muscles to bones. You’re most likely to get a strain in your back or hamstring muscles. Strains cause pain, weakness, swelling, and muscle cramps. You may have
                            trouble moving the muscle.</p>

                        <p>Getting enough sleep is essential for helping a person maintain optimal health and well-being. When it comes to their health, sleep is as vital
                            as regular exercise and eating a balanced diet. Most people have trouble sleeping from time to time because of travel, changes in schedule or lifestyle or stressful situations throughout the day. Lack of sleep can affect emotional
                            and physical health. There are many tips for how to get enough sleep that don’t involve medication or seeing a sleep specialist. Diet modifications, yoga, reducing screen time before bed and bedroom preparation are all important factors
                            in getting to and staying asleep.

                        <p>Some 60% of people will have at least one nosebleed
                            in their lifetime. The location of the nose in the middle of the face and the large number of blood
                            vessels close to the surface in the lining of your nose make it an easy target for injury and
                            nosebleeds.
