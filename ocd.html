                <h2>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</h2>

                <p>What Is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder?</p>

                <p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions) or the urge to do something over and over again (compulsions). Some people can have both obsessions and
                    compulsions. Many people without OCD have distressing thoughts or repetitive behaviors. However, these thoughts and behaviors do not typically disrupt daily life. For people with OCD, thoughts are persistent, and behaviors are rigid.
                    The repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing, checking on things or cleaning, can significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities and social interactions. Not performing the behaviors commonly causes great distress
                </p>

                <h3>TYPES OF OCD</h3>

                <p>OCD comes in many forms, but most cases fall into at least one of four general categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Checking, such as locks, alarm systems, ovens, or light switches, or thinking you have a medical condition like pregnancy or schizophrenia</li>
                    <li>Contamination, a fear of things that might be dirty or a compulsion to clean. Mental contamination involves feeling like you’ve been treated like dirt.</li>
                    <li>Symmetry and ordering, the need to have things lined up in a certain way</li>
                    <li>Ruminations and intrusive thoughts, an obsession with a line of thought. Some of these thoughts might be violent or disturbing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>CAUSES</h3>

                <p>Experts do not know what causes OCD, but there are various theories. Genetic, neurological, behavioral, cognitive, and environmental factors may all contribute.</p>

                <h3>RISK FACTORS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A parent, sibling, or child with OCD</li>
                    <li>differences in certain parts of your brain</li>
                    <li>Depression, anxiety, or tics </li>
                    <li>Experience with trauma</li>
                    <li>A history of physical or sexual abuse as a child</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>SYMPTOMS</h3>

                <p>Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that cause distressing emotions such as anxiety or disgust. Obsessive thoughts can include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Worries about yourself or other people getting hurt</li>
                    <li>Constant awareness of blinking, breathing, or other body sensations</li>
                    <li>Suspicion that a partner is unfaithful, with no reason to believe it</li>
                    <li>Fear of getting contaminated by people or the environment</li>
                    <li>Disturbing sexual thoughts or images</li>
                    <li>Fear of blurting out obscenities or insults</li>
                    <li>Recurrent intrusive thoughts of sounds, images, words, or numbers</li>
                    <li>Fear of losing or discarding something important</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Compulsions are ritualistic or repetitive behaviors or mental acts that a person carries out continuously in an attempt to neutralize anxiety related to the obsession (such as repetitive hand-washing when someone is obsessed with contamination
                    or repeated prayers or confession for someone obsessed with blasphemous thoughts) or actions thats are completely unrelated to the obsession Complsive habits can include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Doing tasks in a specific order every time or a certain “good” number of times</li>
                    <li>Excessive or ritualized hand washing, showering, brushing teeth, or toileting</li>
                    <li>Repeated cleaning of household objects</li>
                    <li>Ordering or arranging things in a particular way</li>
                    <li>Repeatedly checking locks, switches, or appliances</li>
                    <li>Constantly seeking approval or reassurance</li>
                    <li>Repeated counting to a certain number</li>
                    <li>Checking rituals (repeatedly making sure the door is</li>
                    <li>locked or the coffee pot is turned off)</li>
                    <li>Counting rituals (each step taken, ceiling tiles, concrete</li>
                    <li>blocks, or desks in a classroom)</li>
                    <li>Washing and scrubbing until the skin is raw</li>
                    <li>Hoarding items (for fear of throwing away something important)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Management Some treatment options available are: Psychotherapy, Relaxation and Medication. If a person with mild OCD does not receive treatment, the symptoms may still improve. However, without treatment, symptoms of moderate or severe
                    OCD do not improve and may worsen.
