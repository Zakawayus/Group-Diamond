                <h2>BURNS</h2>

                <p>A burn is tissue damage that results from scalding, overexposure to the sun or other radiation, contact with flames, chemicals or electricity, or smoke inhalation. Grabbing a hot pot or splashing boiling water on your skin are just two
                    common causes of burns around the house. When you get a burn, first check to see which type it is. Some are more serious than others.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>First-degree burns are painful but minor. They turn red and may swell.</li>
                    <li>Second-degree burns form blisters. The skin may be very red and painful.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Serious burns need to be treated by a doctor or in a hospital. Call for medical help if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have a third-degree burn.</li>
                    <li>The burn is larger than 2 to 3 inches.</li>
                    <li>The burn is on your face, hands, feet, or over a joint like your shoulder or knee.</li>
                    <li>The burn goes all the way around a hand, arm, foot, or leg.</li>
                    <li>The pain gets worse instead of better.</li>
                    <li>The burn was caused by electricity or a chemical.</li>
                    <li>You see fluid or pus oozing from the burn.</li>
                    <p>Until emergency help arrives:</p>
                    <li>Protect the burned person from further harm. If you can do so safely, make sure the person you're helping is not in contact with the source of the burn. For electrical burns, make sure the power source is off before you approach the
                        burned person.</li>
                    <li>Make certain that the person burned is breathing. If needed, begin rescue breathing if you know how.
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove jewelry, belts and other restrictive items, especially from around burned areas and the neck. Burned areas swell rapidly. </li>
                    <li>Cover the area of the burn. Use a cool, moist bandage or a clean cloth.</li>
                    <li>Don't immerse large severe burns in water. Doing so could cause a serious loss of body heat (hypothermia).
                    </li>
                    <li>Elevate the burned area. Raise the wound above heart level, if possible.</li>
                    <li>Watch for signs of shock. Signs and symptoms include fainting, pale complexion or breathing in a notably shallow fashion.</li>
                    <p>For minor burns:</p>
                    <li>Cool the burn. Hold the burned area under cool (not cold) running water or apply a cool, wet compress until the pain eases.</li>
                    <li>Remove rings or other tight items from the burned area. Try to do this quickly and gently, before the area swells.</li>
                    <li>Don't break blisters. Fluid-filled blisters protect against infection. If a blister breaks, clean the area with water (mild soap is optional). Apply an antibiotic ointment. But if a rash appears, stop using the ointment.</li>
                    <li>Apply lotion. Once a burn is completely cooled, apply a lotion, such as one that contains aloe vera or a moisturizer. This helps prevent drying and provides relief.</li>
                    <li>Bandage the burn. Cover the burn with a sterile gauze bandage (not fluffy cotton). Wrap it loosely to avoid putting pressure on burned skin. Bandaging keeps air off the area, reduces pain and protects blistered skin.</li>
                    <li>If needed, take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).</li>
                </ul>

                        <p>A sprain is a stretch or tear of a ligament, the tough tissue that connects bones and supports the joints. You’re most likely to get a sprain in the wrist or ankle. Sprains cause pain, bruising, and swelling. You may have trouble
                            moving the joint. A strain is an injury to a muscle or tendon, the thick tissue that attaches muscles to bones. You’re most likely to get a strain in your back or hamstring muscles. Strains cause pain, weakness, swelling, and
                            muscle cramps. You may have trouble moving the muscle.</p>

                        <p>A nosebleed is the loss of blood from the tissue that lines the inside of your nose. Nosebleeds (also called epistaxis) are common. Some 60% of people will have at least one nosebleed in their lifetime. The location of the nose
                            in the middle of the face and the large number of blood vessels close to the surface in the lining of your nose make it an easy target for injury and nosebleeds. </p>

                        <p>Blood group is the classification of blood-based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of Red Blood Cells (RBCs). These antigens may be proteins, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, or glycolipids,

                        <p>Most cuts and grazes are minor and can be easily treated at home. Stopping the bleeding, cleaning the wound thoroughly and covering it with a plaster or dressing is usually all that's needed. Minor wounds should start to heal within
                            a few days.</p>
