            <h1>Mental Health Disorder</h1>

            <p>Mental health disorders, sometimes referred to as illnesses, affect the thoughts, moods and behaviors of those impacted. Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing
                signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.</p>

            <p>A history of mental illness in a blood relative, stressful life situations, such as financial problems, a loved one's death or a divorce, an ongoing (chronic) medical condition, such as diabetes, traumatic brain injury such as a violent blow
                to the head, traumatic experiences, such as military combat or assault, use of alcohol or recreational drugs, a childhood history of abuse or neglect and few friends or few healthy relationships; can influence the onset of depression,
                anxiety and other conditions.</p>

            <p>Mental health disorders may be occasional or chronic. And they affect an individualâ€™s ability to relate to others and function day-to-day. While there are some steps to improve overall mental health, some disorders are more serious and may
                require professional intervention.</p>

                    <p> Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions) or the urge to do something over and over again (compulsions). Some people can have both obsessions
                        and compulsions. Many people without OCD have distressing thoughts or repetitive behaviors. However, these thoughts and behaviors do not typically disrupt daily life. For people with OCD, thoughts are persistent, and behaviors
                        are rigid. </p>

                    <p> Post-traumatic stress disorder can occur in a person who has witnessed an extraordinarily terrifying and potentially deadly event. After the traumatic event, the person re-experiences all or some of it through dreams or waking recollections
                        and responds defensively to these flashbacks. New behaviors develop related to the trauma, such as sleep difficulties, hyper-vigilance, thinking difficulties, severe startle response, and agitation. People with P.T.S.D have intense,
                        disturbing thoughts and feelings related to their experience that last long after the traumatic event has ended. </p>
