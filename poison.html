                <h3>POISONS</h3>
                <p>Poisoning is injury or death due to swallowing, inhaling, touching or injecting various drugs, chemicals, venoms or gases. Many substances — such as drugs and carbon monoxide — are poisonous only in higher concentrations or dosages. And
                    others — such as cleaners — are dangerous only if ingested. Children are particularly sensitive to even small amounts of certain drugs and chemicals. How someone who may have been poisoned is treated depends on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The person’s symptoms</li>
                    <li>The person’s age</li>
                    <li>Whether you know the type and amount of the substance that caused poisoning</li>
                </ul>
                <p>ALWAYS call for emergency help first. While waiting, there are some quick first aid measures that make a difference if accomplished within seconds to minutes of the poison exposure.</p>

                <h3>SWALLOWED POISONS</h3>
                <p>Drink a small amount of water or milk immediately, if: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The product swallowed is burning, irritating or caustic, and </li>
                    <li>The person is conscious, not having convulsions, and able to swallow.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>POISONS IN THE EYE </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It’s important that you irrigate (rinse the exposed eyes) immediately. Every second matters and a delay could result in loss of sight. Remove contact lenses.</li>
                    <li>Use lots of room temperature water and irrigate for at least 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Adults and older children may find it easier to hop in the shower. Wrap young children in a towel and let water from the faucet in the kitchen sink run over the eye – or slowly pour water from a pitcher. Let the water hit the bridge
                        of the nose and gently run into the eyes rather than pouring the water directly into the eye. It is important that irrigation is for at least 15 to 20 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Encourage Blinking.</li>
                    <li>After the 15 to 20 minute irrigation, let the eye rest while you call for additional help.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>POISONS ON THE SKIN</h3>
                <p>It’s important that you rinse the exposed skin immediately. Remove contaminated clothing first (that’s clothing with a spill). Every second matters. Don’t delay. Use lots of room temperature running water and rinse for at least 15 minutes.
                    For large spills, adults and older children may find it easiest to hop in the shower. Mild hand soap can be used to remove material that sticks to the skin. Important: Rinse for at least 15 minutes. After the 15 minute rinse, call
                    emergency for additional guidance. If blistering, large or deep burns, pain, redness, or swelling worsen or persist, you will need to see a doctor right away, go straight to an emergency room after rinsing. Don’t wait. After irrigating,
                    call the ambulance or visit the hospital.</p>

                <h3>POISONS INHALED</h3>
                <p>It’s important that you move to fresh air immediately. Stay away from all toxic fumes and gases. Thoroughly ventilate the involved area. After moving to fresh air, call the ambulance or visit the hospital.

                        <p>A burn is tissue damage that results from scalding, overexposure to the sun or other radiation, contact with flames, chemicals or electricity, or smoke inhalation. Grabbing a hot pot or splashing boiling water on your skin are
                            just two common causes of burns around the house. When you get a burn, first check to see which type it is. Some are more serious than others.</p>

                        <p>A nosebleed is the loss of blood from the tissue that lines the inside of your nose. Nosebleeds (also called epistaxis) are common. Some 60% of people will have at least one nosebleed in their lifetime. The location of the nose
                            in the middle of the face and the large number of blood vessels close to the surface in the lining of your nose make it an easy target for injury and nosebleeds. </p>

                        <p>A sprain is a stretch or tear of a ligament, the tough tissue that connects bones and supports the joints. You’re most likely to get a sprain in the wrist or ankle. Sprains cause pain, bruising, and swelling. You may have trouble
                            moving the joint. A strain is an injury to a muscle or tendon, the thick tissue that attaches muscles to bones. You’re most likely to get a strain in your back or hamstring muscles. Strains cause pain, weakness, swelling, and
                            muscle cramps. You may have trouble moving the muscle.</p>

                        <p>Most cuts and grazes are minor and can be easily treated at home. Stopping the bleeding, cleaning the wound thoroughly and covering it with a plaster or dressing is usually all that's needed. Minor wounds should start to heal within
                            a few days.</p>
