                <h2>Sickle Cell Disease</h2>

                <p>Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. Healthy red blood cells are round, and they move through small blood vessels to carry oxygen to all parts of the body. In someone who has SCD, the red blood cells
                    become hard and sticky and look like a C-shaped farm tool called a “sickle”. The sickle cells die early, which causes a constant shortage of red blood cells (Normal red blood cells can live up to 120 days. But, sickle cells only live
                    for about 10 to 20 days. Also, sickle cells may be destroyed by the spleen because of their shape and stiffness.) Also, when they travel through small blood vessels, they get stuck and clog the blood flow. This can cause pain and other
                    serious problems such infection, acute chest syndrome and stroke.
                </p>

                <h3>TYPES OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE</h3>

                <p>Following are the most common types of SCD:</p>

                <h4>HbSS:</h4>

                <p>People who have this form of SCD inherit two sickle cell genes (“S”), one from each parent. This is commonly called sickle cell anaemia and is usually the most severe form of the disease</p>

                <h4>HbSC</h4>

                <p>People who have this form of SCD inherit a sickle cell gene (“S”) from one parent and from the other parent a gene for abnormal haemoglobin called “C”. Haemoglobin is a protein that allows red blood cells to carry oxygen to all parts of
                    the body. This is usually a milder form of SCD.</p>

                <h4>HbS Beta Thalassemia</h4>

                <p>People who have this form of SCD inherit one sickle cell gene (“S”) from one parent and one gene for beta thalassemia, another type of anaemia, from the other parent. There are two types of beta thalassemia: “0” and “+”. Those with HbS
                    beta 0-thalassemia usually have a severe form of SCD. People with HbS beta +-thalassemia tend to have a milder form of SCD.</p>

                <p><em>There also are a few rare types of SCD:</em></p>
                <h4>HbSD, HbSE, and HbSO</h4>

                <p>People who have these forms of SCD inherit one sickle cell gene (“S”) and one gene from an abnormal type of haemoglobin (“D”, “E”, or “O”). Haemoglobin is a protein that allows red blood cells to carry oxygen to all parts of the body.
                    The severity of these rarer types of SCD varies.</p>

                <h3>CAUSES OF SCD</h3>

                <p>Sickle cell is an inherited disease caused by a defect in a gene. A person will be born with sickle cell disease only if two genes are inherited—one from the mother and one from the father. A person who inherits just one gene is healthy
                    and said to be a "carrier" of the disease. A carrier has an increased chance of having a child with sickle cell disease if he or she has a child with another carrier. For parents who are each carriers of a sickle cell gene, there is
                    a 1 in 4, or a 25% chance of having a child with sickle cell disease.</p>

                <h3>SYMPTOMS</h3>

                <p>The following is a list of symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease. However, each person may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms and complications may include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Anaemia:</li>
                    <p>Because sickled cells are short-lived or destroyed, there are less red blood cells available in the body. This results in anaemia. Severe anaemia can make you feel dizzy, short of breath, and tired</p>

                    <li>Pain crisis or sickle crisis:</li>
                    <p>This occurs when the flow of blood is blocked to an area because the sickled cells have become stuck in the blood vessel. The pain can occur anywhere, but most often occurs in the chest, arms, and legs. Infants and young children may
                        have painful swelling of the fingers and toes. Interruption in blood flow may also cause tissue death.</p>

                    <li>Splenic sequestration (pooling):</li>
                    <p>Crises are a result of sickle cells pooling in the spleen. This can cause a sudden drop in haemoglobin and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. The spleen can also become enlarged and painful from the increase in blood
                        volume. After repeated episodes, the spleen becomes scarred, and permanently damaged. Most children, by age 8, do not have a working spleen either from surgical removal, or from repeated episodes of splenic sequestration.</p>

                    <li>Jaundice or yellowing of the skin, eyes, and mouth:</li>
                    <p>Jaundice is a common sign and symptom of sickle disease. Sickle cells do not live as long as normal red blood cells and, therefore, they are dying faster than the liver can filter them out. Bilirubin (which causes the yellow colour)
                        from these broken down cells builds up in the system causing jaundice.</p>

                    <li>Priapism:</li>
                    <p>This is a painful obstruction of the blood vessels in the penis by sickle cells. If not promptly treated, it can result in impotence.</p>

                </ul>

                <p><em>The symptoms of sickle cell disease may look like other blood disorders or medical problems. Always consult your health care provider for a diagnosis.</em></p>

                <h3>DIAGNOSIS</h3>

                <p>SCD is diagnosed with a simple blood test. It most often is found at birth during routine new-born screening tests at the hospital. In addition, SCD can be diagnosed before birth. Because children with SCD are at an increased risk of infection
                    and other health problems, early diagnosis and treatment are important. Visit your local sickle cell organization to find out how to get tested.</p>

                <h3>COMPLICATIONS</h3>

                <p>People with SCD start to have signs of the disease during the first year of life, usually around 5 months of age. Symptoms and complications of SCD are different for each person and can range from mild to severe. There is no single best
                    treatment for all people with SCD. Treatment options are different for each person depending on the symptoms. Any and all major organs are affected by sickle cell disease. The liver, heart, kidneys, gallbladder, eyes, bones, and joints
                    can suffer damage from the abnormal function of the sickle cells and their inability to flow through the small blood vessels correctly.</p>

                <p>Problems may include the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Increased infections</li>
                    <li>Leg ulcers</li>
                    <li>Bone damage</li>
                    <li>Early gallstones</li>
                    <li>Kidney damage and loss of body water in the urine</li>
                    <li>Eye damage</li>
                    <li>Multiple organ failure</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>TREATMENT</h3>

                <p>The only cure for SCD is bone marrow or stem cell transplant. Bone marrow is a soft, fatty tissue inside the centre of the bones where blood cells are made. A bone marrow or stem cell transplant is a procedure that takes healthy cells
                    that form blood from one person—the donor and puts them into someone whose bone marrow is not working properly. Bone marrow or stem cell transplants are very risky, and can have serious side effects, including death. For the transplant
                    to work, the bone marrow must be a close match. Usually, the best donor is a brother or sister. Bone marrow or stem cell transplants are used only in cases of severe SCD for children who have minimal organ damage from the disease.</p>

                <h3>LIVING WITH SICKLE CELL DISEASE</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sickle cell disease is a life-long condition. Although the complications of sickle cell disease may not be able to be prevented entirely, living a healthy life-style can reduce some of the complications.</li>

                    <li>It is important to eat a healthy diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein, and drink lots of fluids.</li>

                    <li>Do not take decongestants because they cause constriction of blood vessels and could trigger a crisis.</li>

                    <li>Other factors that may trigger a crisis include high altitudes, cold weather, swimming in cold water, and heavy physical labor.</li>

                    <li>Avoid infections by getting an annual flu shot, washing your hands frequently, avoiding those who are sick, and getting regular dental exams.</li>

                        <p>Most cuts and grazes are minor and can be easily treated at home. Stopping the bleeding, cleaning the wound thoroughly and covering it with a plaster or dressing is usually all that's needed. Minor wounds should start to heal within a
                            few days.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Wash your hands. First, wash up with soap and water so you don’t get bacteria into the cut and cause an infection. If you’re on the go, use hand sanitizer.</li>
                            <li>Stop the bleeding. Put pressure on the cut with a gauze pad or clean cloth. Keep the pressure on for a few minutes.</li>
                            <li>Clean the wound. Once you’ve stopped the bleeding, rinse the cut under cool running water or use a saline wound wash. Clean the area around the wound with soap and a wet washcloth. Don’t get soap in the cut, because it can irritate
                                the skin. And don’t use hydrogen peroxide or iodine, which could irritate the cut.</li>
                            <li>Remove any dirt or debris. Use a pair of tweezers cleaned with alcohol to gently pick out any dirt, gravel, glass, or other material in the cut. Check with your doctor or go to the emergency room if:</li>

                        <p>Foodborne illness, more commonly referred to as food poisoning, is the result of eating contaminated, spoiled, or toxic food. It can resolve on its own or progress to a distressing condition requiring hospital attention.</p>

                <h3>Causes of Food Poisoning</h3>

                <p>Most food poisoning can be traced to one of the following three major causes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bacteria e.g E- coli, Salmonella, C-Botulinum etc.</li>
