                <h2>Stress</h2>

                <p>Stress is how the brain and body respond to any demand. In a dangerous situation, stress signals the body to prepare to face a threat or flee to safety. 
                    In these situations, your pulse quickens, you breathe faster, your muscles tense, and your brain uses more oxygen and increases activity—all functions aimed at survival and in response to stress. 
                    In non-life-threatening situations, stress can motivate people, such as when they need to take a test or interview for a new job. 
                    Coping with the impact of chronic stress can be challenging. Because the source of long-term stress is more constant than acute stress, the body never receives a clear signal to return to normal functioning. 
                    With chronic stress, those same lifesaving reactions in the body can disturb the immune, digestive, cardiovascular, sleep, and reproductive systems. 
                    Some people may experience mainly digestive symptoms, while others may have headaches, sleeplessness, sadness, anger, or irritability. 
                    Over time, continued strain on your body from stress may contribute to serious health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other illnesses, including mental disorders such as depression or anxiety.
                </p>

                <p>Any type of challenge—such as performance at work or school, a significant life change, or a traumatic event—can be stressful. 
                    Examples of stress include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Routine stress related to the pressures of school, work, family, and other daily responsibilities.</li>

                    <li>Stress brought about by a sudden negative change, such as losing a job, divorce, or illness.</li>

                    <li>Traumatic stress experienced during an event such as a major accident, war, assault, or natural disaster where people may be in danger of being seriously hurt or killed. 
                        People who experience traumatic stress may have very distressing temporary emotional and physical symptoms, but most recover naturally soon after.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>CAUSES</h3>

                <p>Stress produces physical symptoms and many of its roots can be traced to the workplace.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Work-life balance: Women are spending more hours working than ever before, leaving less time for personal obligations. 
                        Meanwhile, they shoulder a large caretaking burden (children and the elderly).
                    </li>

                    <li>Relationships: Some women might want to telecommute or maintain non-traditional hours to enable them to fulfill personal obligations, but many employers still dislike flexible working arrangements. 
                        Other women struggle with pervasive issues, like sexism or discrimination.
                    </li>

                    <li>Technology: Mobile devices, like laptops and smartphones, creep into our personal time. 
                        “Ever-present technology makes it more difficult for already time-strapped women to unplug from work and to have any real downtime.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>SYMPTOMS</h3>

                <p>STRESS may cause an individual to feel:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Anxious</li>

                    <li>Afraid</li>

                    <li>Angry or aggressive</li>

                    <li>Sad</li>

                    <li>Irritable</li>

                    <li>Frustrated</li>

                    <li>Depressed.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The individual may also withdraw from other people or snap at them, be indecisive or inflexible, be tearful, have problems getting to sleep or staying asleep, experience sexual problems, smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs more than usual. 
                    He or she may experience these symptoms:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Headaches</li>

                    <li>Nausea</li>

                    <li>Indigestion</li>

                    <li>Shallow breathing or hyperventilating</li>
                    
                    <li>Sweating</li>

                    <li>Heart palpitations</li>

                    <li>Aches and pains.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If the stress is long-lasting, you may notice your sleep and memory are affected, your eating habits change, or you feel less inclined to exercise.</p>
                
                <h3>HOW TO COPE AND MANAGE STRESS AT ANY AGE WITH STRESS</h3>

                <p>We all deal with stress differently. Our ability to cope can depend on our genetics, early life events, personality and social and economic circumstances. 
                    Experiencing stress is inevitable, but managed well; stress can promote emotional and intellectual growth and resilience as we age:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Exercise: Incorporate regular spurts of movement into your day, particularly if you spend most of your time sitting behind a desk. 
                        The exercise doesn’t need to be vigorous. Even short daytime walks are helpful. Use a fitness tracker or app on your phone to track your progress.
                    </li>

                    <li>Sleep: Sleep boosts mood and helps us to deal with daily challenges more effectively. 
                        Wind down two hours prior to bed by stopping work, and avoid caffeine beginning in the late afternoon. 
                        Studies suggest that mobile phone use in adults can ruin your chances of getting a good night’s sleep. 
                        So shut off your devices in the evening and wake up at the same time each day to allow your body’s natural sleeping rhythm to express itself.
                    </li>

                    <li>Find time for pleasure and joy: Prioritize hobbies and do them on a regular basis, whether it’s family time or community activism. 
                        Having purpose and meaning in your life is key to job satisfaction.
                    </li>

                    <li>Stay Connected: Maintaining, improving, and increasing healthy relationships with supportive friends and family powerfully promotes resilience. 
                        Many find that connections with a faith family, neighbors, and even pets, help them feel positive and energetic, even if children and grandchildren aren’t close at hand.
                    </li>

                    <li>Identify your triggers: Once you know where your stress is coming from -a relationship, kids, workload, a health problem; you can sometimes reduce or prevent the stress. 
                        After giving the matter some focused thought, you may identify practical steps to improve the situation. 
                        Even if changing the trigger isn’t possible, a shift in perspective may help mitigate stress. 
                        For example, if a friend is pushing your buttons, stepping back and adjusting your expectations may allow you to keep this close bond.
                    </li>

                    <li>Stay active: Physical activity releases feel-good endorphins. Taking short walking breaks several times a day is a powerful tool for channeling stress. 
                        Exercising or joining yoga, dance, or tai chi classes with friends also helps achieve step 4—staying connected.
                    </li>

                    <li>Find your “pause” button: After experiencing times of great change, high demand, or significant loss, it’s essential to press pause and rest. In order to create time and space for rest you may have to say no to some invitations or requests. 
                        Consider spending quiet time daily: contemplation, reflection, and breathing fosters resilience and calm.
                    </li>

                    <li>Plan your fun: To prevent the daily rush from consuming your life, plan your fun for the day, week, month, or year. Instead of surfing through webs or TV channels, make a date to watch a special program, alone or with a loved one. 
                        Plan a monthly game night with friends and ask them to bring goodies to share. Identify fun activities that suit you, and schedule them.
                    </li>

                    <li>Reframe your thinking about stress itself: Stress responses, including faster heart rate and breathing, evolved to improve our performance in stressful situations. 
                        Reminding yourself of stress’ evolutionary value may improve your performance and paradoxically reduce feelings of stress, in that you’re not adding “stress about stress” to the stress the original trigger aroused.
                    </li>

                    <li>Get professional help: If you continue to feel overwhelmed by stress, don’t be afraid to seek professional help. It doesn’t mean you’re a failure. 
                        It’s important to get help as soon as possible so you can start to feel better.</li>
