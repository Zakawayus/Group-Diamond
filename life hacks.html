                    <h3>LIFE HEALTH TIPS</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Know how many steps you take per day. Moving a lot improves every other heart-health measure and disease risk. That’s why he often urges walking up to 10,000 steps a day, or almost five miles. Another rule of thumb is to exercise
                            150 minutes per week. “It’s better to be active than inactive</li>
                        <li>Know your blood pressure.High blood pressure, or hypertension has no symptoms; it can only be detected by being measured. A score of 120/80 is optimal, and 140/90 is normal for most people. Higher readings mean that arteries aren’t
                            responding right to the force of blood pushing against artery walls (blood pressure), directly raising the risk of heart attack or stroke.
                        </li>
                        <li>Know your non-HDL cholesterol. That is your total cholesterol reading minus your HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, a measure of fats in the blood that can narrow and clog arteries to the heart. Lower is better: Aim for
                            a score lower than 130 mg/dL or, if you’re at a high risk of heart disease, lower than 70–100 mg/dL.</li>
                        <li>Know Your blood sugar. High blood sugar ups your risk of diabetes, which damages arteries. In fact, type 1 and type 2 Diabetes are among the most harmful risk factors for cardiovascular disease.</li>
                        <li>Know How many hours of sleep a night you get. Although there’s no one “right” answer for all, consistently getting the number of hours that works for you helps lower the risk of heart disease. Most people need to sleep six to eight
                            hours a night.</li>
                        <li>Drink more water throughout the day than at night.</li>
                        <li>Eat fruit for dessert instead of cookies.</li>
                        <li>Plan and prepare healthy meals and snacks to increase your chance of success.</li>
                        <li>Keep healthy snacks at work. Pack healthy lunches that you make at home.</li>
                        <li>Pay attention to your feelings of hunger. Learn the difference between physical hunger and habitual eating or eating as a response to stress or boredom.</li>
                        <li>Drink skim or low-fat (1%) milk instead of 2% or whole milk.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>LIFE TIPS ON SAFETY AT HOME</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Families can promote everyday safety by taking a closer look at their home environment, lifestyle and potential risks.</li>
                        <li>To keep the entire family safe, it’s vital to find problems early and respond quickly to risky situations. There are several safety rules and guidelines associated with recreational activities inside and outside the home.</li>
                        <li> At home, following the safety rules will keep children safe while playing and prevent problems such as falling, drowning, strangulation, suffocation and choking.</li>
                        <li>Follow labels and ensure that toys are given to children based on age recommendations. Sports on wheels, including bicycles, inline skates, scooters and skateboards, pose potential safety risks. Participants should wear protective
                            gear (e.g., helmets) and avoid dangerous behaviors.</li>
                        <li> Traveling is another important time to consider safety. When traveling by car, parents should follow guidelines for seat belts and car seats based on the age and size of their children. When traveling by plane, following air travel
                            tips can help passengers stay safe and comfortable. If traveling by cruise ship, regulations are in place to control sanitation and prevent gastrointestinal issues. Whether at home or on travel, be sure to follow water safety
                            guidelines and take steps to prevent children from drowning.</li>
