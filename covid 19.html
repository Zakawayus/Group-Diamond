                <h2>CORONA VIRUS (COVID-19)</h2>

                <p>Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A coronavirus identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19.
                </p>

                <h3>How did the coronavirus start?</h3>

                <p>The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the cause was a then-new coronavirus later named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal and changed (mutated) so it could cause illness in humans. In the past,
                    several infectious disease outbreaks have been traced to viruses originating in birds, pigs, bats and other animals that mutated to become dangerous to humans. Research continues, and more study may reveal how and why the coronavirus
                    evolved to cause pandemic disease.

                </p>

                <h3>How does the coronavirus spread?</h3>

                <p> As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets may fall to the ground in
                    a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing
                    are essential to preventing COVID-19.
                </p>

                <p><strong>What is the incubation period for COVID-19?</strong></p>

                <p>Symptoms show up in people within two to 14 days of exposure to the virus. A person infected with the coronavirus is contagious to others for up to two days before symptoms appear, and they remain contagious to others for 10 to 20 days,
                    depending upon their immune system and the severity of their illness.
                </p>

                <h3>What are symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19)?</h3>

                <p> The most common symptoms are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cough</li>

                    <li>Fever or chills</li>

                    <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>

                    <li>Muscle or body aches</li>

                    <li>Sore throat</li>

                    <li>New loss of taste or smell</li>

                    <li>Diarrhea</li>

                    <li>Headache</li>

                    <li>New fatigue</li>

                    <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>

                    <li>Congestion or runny nose</li>

                </ul>

                <p>Some of these symptoms are very common and can occur in many conditions other than COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS CoV-2 coronavirus. If you have any of them, contact a doctor or health care provider so they can assess your risk
                    and help you determine next steps.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Emergency Warning Signs of Severe COVID-19</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty breathing</li>

                    <li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest</li>

                    <li>New confusion</li>

                    <li>Inability to wake up or stay awake</li>

                    <li>Bluish lips or face</li>

                </ul>

                <p>There are other possible symptoms of COVID-19: Call your doctor or visit the hospital for any symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.</p>

                <h3>Frequently Asked Questions on Coronaviruses</h3>

                <p><strong> you have COVID-19 without symptoms?</strong></p>

                <p>Yes. Symptoms of COVID-19 usually show up from two to 14 days after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, but some people who are infected do not develop symptoms or feel ill. This is why it is so important to wear a face mask and practice
                    physical distancing and hand hygiene. People can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and not realize it, but still be able to transmit it to other people.
                </p>

                <p><strong>What are COVID-19 symptoms in children?</strong></p>

                <p>Like adults, babies and children with COVID-19 can have fever, cough, sore throat, difficulty breathing and diarrhea. Children with COVID-19 generally have milder illness than adults and rarely require treatment at a hospital. But in a
                    few reported cases, very young babies have become seriously ill with pneumonia due to infection with the coronavirus. Children may also be at risk for a very rare complication of the coronavirus called multisystem inflammatory syndrome
                    in children, or MIS-C. Parents should be on guard for signs of MIS-C and call their child’s doctor immediately if they appear.
                </p>

                <p><strong>If I'm exposed to the coronavirus, how long before I develop symptoms?</strong></p>

                <p>Symptoms can begin between two and 14 days after you have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. A study led by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health shows that the median time for symptoms to show
                    up is about five days. That is why the CDC uses the 14-day quarantine period for people following exposure to the coronavirus.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Can you have coronavirus without a fever?</strong></p>

                <p>Yes, you can be infected with the coronavirus and have a cough or other symptoms with no fever, or a very low-grade one, especially in the first few days. Keep in mind that it is also possible to have COVID-19 with minimal or even no symptoms
                    at all. People infected with the coronavirus who have no symptoms can still spread COVID-19 to others.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Can COVID symptoms come and go?</strong></p>

                <p>Yes. During the recovery process, people with COVID-19 might experience recurring symptoms alternating with periods of feeling better. Varying degrees of fever, fatigue and breathing problems can occur, on and off, for days or even weeks.
                </p>

                <p><strong> Are there different variants of this coronavirus?</strong></p>

                <p>Yes, there are different variants of this coronavirus. Like other viruses, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can change (mutate). In December 2020, B.1.1.7, a new variant, was identified in the United Kingdom, and since then, variants
                    have appeared in other locations around the world, including B.1.351, first isolated in South Africa, and others. Mutations may enable the coronavirus to spread faster from person to person, and may cause more severe disease. More
                    infections can result in more people getting very sick and also create more opportunity for the virus to develop further mutations.
                </p>

                <h3> Preventing coronavirus</h3>

                <p>Vaccines are now authorized to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But until more is understood about how the vaccines affect a person’s ability to transmit the virus, precautions such as mask-wearing,
                    physical distancing and hand hygiene should continue regardless of a person’s vaccination status to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine and ways to protect yourself.

                        <p>Sickle cell is an inherited disease caused by a defect in a gene. A person will be born with sickle cell disease only if two genes are inherited—one from the mother and one from the father. A person who inherits just one gene is
                            healthy and said to be a "carrier" of the disease. A carrier has an increased chance of having a child with sickle cell disease if he or she has a child with another carrier. For parents who are each carriers of a sickle cell
                            gene, there is a 1 in 4, or a 25% chance of having a child with sickle cell disease.

                        <p>Some 60% of people will have at least one nosebleed in their lifetime. You will need medical attention for this type of bleed, especially if the bleeding occurs after an injury and the bleeding hasn’t stopped after 20 minutes of

                        <p>Poisoning is injury or death due to swallowing, inhaling, touching or injecting various drugs, chemicals, venoms or gases. Many substances — such as drugs and carbon monoxide — are poisonous only in higher concentrations or dosages.
                            And others — such as cleaners — are dangerous only if ingested. Children are particularly sensitive to even small amounts of certain drugs and chemicals. How someone who may have been poisoned is treated depends on...</p>
