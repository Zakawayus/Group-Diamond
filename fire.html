                <h3> BURN: SAFETY AT HOME </h3>
                <p>Many ordinary things in a home — from bath water to hot food to electrical outlets — can cause burns especially childhood burns. To prevent burns, follow these burn safety tips: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Reduce water temperature. Set the thermostat on your water heater to below 120 F (48.9 C). Always test the water temperature before your child gets in the tub. Aim for bath water around 100 F (38 C).</li>
                    <li>Avoid hot spills. Don't cook, drink, or carry hot beverages or soup while holding a child. Keep hot foods and liquids away from table and counter edges. </li>
                    <li>Don't use tablecloths or placemats, which young children can pull down.</li>
                    <li>When you're using the stove, use back burners and turn the handles of your pots and pans toward the rear of the stove. </li>
                    <li>Avoid leaving food cooking on the stove unattended. </li>
                    <li>Establish “no” zones. Block access to the stove and fireplace, and make space heaters and water heaters inaccessible. </li>
                    <li>Unplug irons. Store items designed to get hot, such as clothes irons, unplugged and out of reach. </li>
                    <li>Test food temperature. Food or liquids warmed in a microwave might heat unevenly. </li>
                    <li>Choose a cool-water humidifier or vaporizer. If you use a hot-steam vaporizer, keep it out of reach. </li>
                    <li>Address outlets and electrical cords. Cover unused electrical outlets with safety caps.
                    </li>
                    <li>Inserting a fork, key, or other metal object into an outlet could result in an electrical burn. </li>
                    <li>Keep electrical cords and wires out of the way so children don't chew on them. </li>
                    <li>Replace damaged, brittle, or frayed electrical cords. </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>BURN: SAFETY OUTDOORS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watch grills and fire pits. Don't allow children to play near these potential hazards. </li>
                    <li>straps or buckles. If you park in direct sunlight, cover the car seat with a towel or blanket.
                    </li>
                    <li>Forgo backyard fireworks. Leave fireworks, including sparklers, to trained professionals. </li>
                </ul>

                <h3> FIRE SAFETY </h3>
                <p>The importance of fire safety can not be over-emphasized. Take these simple precautions to prevent fires:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lock up matches and lighters. Store matches, lighters, and flammable liquids in a locked cabinet or drawer. Teach children that matches and lighters aren't toys. </li>
                    <li>Be careful with candles and cigarettes. Keep burning candles out of reach, and extinguish candles before leaving the room. If you smoke, avoid smoking in the house — especially in bed. Be sure cigarettes are completely out before throwing
                        them away. </li>
                    <li>Use space heaters with care. Keep space heaters at least three feet away from bedding, drapes, furniture, and other flammable materials. Keep children away from space heaters. Never leave a space heater on when you go to sleep or place
                        a space heater near someone who's sleeping. </li>
                    <li>Keep your fireplace clean. An annual cleaning and inspection can help prevent a chimney fire.
                    </li>
                    <li>In case of emergency, keep up-to-date fire extinguishers handy throughout your home. </li>
                </ul>

                        <p>A burn is tissue damage that results from scalding, overexposure to the sun or other radiation, contact with flames, chemicals or electricity, or smoke inhalation. Grabbing a hot pot or splashing boiling water on your skin are
                            just two common causes of burns around the house. When you get a burn, first check to see which type it is. Some are more serious than others.</p>

                        <p>A nosebleed is the loss of blood from the tissue that lines the inside of your nose. Nosebleeds (also called epistaxis) are common. Some 60% of people will have at least one nosebleed in their lifetime. The location of the nose
                            in the middle of the face and the large number of blood vessels close to the surface in the lining of your nose make it an easy target for injury and nosebleeds. </p>

                        <p>Blood group is the classification of blood-based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of Red Blood Cells (RBCs). These antigens may be proteins, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, or glycolipids,
                            depending on the Blood Group System.

                        <p>Most cuts and grazes are minor and can be easily treated at home. Stopping the bleeding, cleaning the wound thoroughly and covering it with a plaster or dressing is usually all that's needed. Minor wounds should start to heal within
                            a few days.

                        <p>A sprain is a stretch or tear of a ligament, the tough tissue that connects bones and supports the joints. You’re most likely to get a sprain in the wrist or ankle. Sprains cause pain, bruising, and swelling. You may have trouble
                            moving the joint. A strain is an injury to a muscle or tendon, the thick tissue that attaches muscles to bones. You’re most likely to get a strain in your back or hamstring muscles. Strains cause pain, weakness, swelling, and
                            muscle cramps. You may have trouble moving the muscle.
