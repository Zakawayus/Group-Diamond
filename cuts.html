                <h2>CUTS & SCRAPES</h2>
                <p>Most cuts and grazes are minor and can be easily treated at home. Stopping the bleeding, cleaning the wound thoroughly and covering it with a plaster or dressing is usually all that's needed. Minor wounds should start to heal within a
                    few days.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash your hands. First, wash up with soap and water so you don’t get bacteria into the cut and cause an infection. If you’re on the go, use hand sanitizer.</li>
                    <li>Stop the bleeding. Put pressure on the cut with a gauze pad or clean cloth. Keep the pressure on for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Clean the wound. Once you’ve stopped the bleeding, rinse the cut under cool running water or use a saline wound wash. Clean the area around the wound with soap and a wet washcloth. Don’t get soap in the cut, because it can irritate
                        the skin. And don’t use hydrogen peroxide or iodine, which could irritate the cut.</li>
                    <li>Remove any dirt or debris. Use a pair of tweezers cleaned with alcohol to gently pick out any dirt, gravel, glass, or other material in the cut. Check with your doctor or go to the emergency room if:</li>
                </ol>

                <ul>
                    <li>The cut is deep, long, or the edges are jagged. You may need stitches and a tetanus shot.</li>
                    <li>The cut or scrape is from a dirty or rusty object. You may need a tetanus shot.</li>
                    <li>The injury is from an animal or human bite.</li>
                    <li>You can’t stop the bleeding with direct pressure.</li>
                    <li>You can’t get dirt out of the wound. </li>
                    <li>The cut is on your face or near a joint, like on your fingers. </li>
                    <li>The skin around the cut gets red and swollen or develops red streaks.</li>
                    <li>Pus drains from the cut.</li>
                    <li>You have a fever of more than 100.4 F (in either an adult or child).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Visit an emergency centre if there's a risk your wound could become infected, or you think it's already infected. A wound is at risk of infection if:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>it's been contaminated with dirt, pus or other bodily fluids</li>
                    <li>there was something in the wound before it was cleaned, such as gravel or a shard of glass</li>
                    <li>it has a jagged edge</li>
                    <li>it's longer than 5cm (2 inches)</li>
                    <li>it was caused by an animal or human bite</li>
                    <li>Signs a wound has become infected include:</li>
                    <li>swelling, redness and increasing pain in the affected area</li>
                    <li>pus forming in or around the wound</li>
                    <li>feeling generally unwell</li>
                    <li>a high temperature (fever) of 38C or above</li>
                    <li>swollen glands under your chin or in your neck, armpits or groin</li>
                </ul>

                        <p>A burn is tissue damage that results from scalding, overexposure to the sun or other radiation, contact with flames, chemicals or electricity, or smoke inhalation. Grabbing a hot pot or splashing boiling water on your skin are
                            just two common causes of burns around the house. When you get a burn, first check to see which type it is. Some are more serious than others.</p>

                        <p>A nosebleed is the loss of blood from the tissue that lines the inside of your nose. Nosebleeds (also called epistaxis) are common. Some 60% of people will have at least one nosebleed in their lifetime. The location of the nose
                            in the middle of the face and the large number of blood vessels close to the surface in the lining of your nose make it an easy target for injury and nosebleeds. </p>

                        <p>Poisoning is injury or death due to swallowing, inhaling, touching or injecting various drugs, chemicals, venoms or gases. Many substances — such as drugs and carbon monoxide — are poisonous only in higher concentrations or dosages.
                            And others — such as cleaners — are dangerous only if ingested. Children are particularly sensitive to even small amounts of certain drugs and chemicals. How someone who may have been poisoned is treated depends on...</p>

                        <p>A sprain is a stretch or tear of a ligament, the tough tissue that connects bones and supports the joints. You’re most likely to get a sprain in the wrist or ankle. Sprains cause pain, bruising, and swelling. You may have trouble
                            moving the joint. A strain is an injury to a muscle or tendon, the thick tissue that attaches muscles to bones. You’re most likely to get a strain in your back or hamstring muscles. Strains cause pain, weakness, swelling, and
                            muscle cramps. You may have trouble moving the muscle.</p>
